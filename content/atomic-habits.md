### The 1% Rule
* Related: [[Aggregation of Marginal Gains]], [[Compound Effect]]
* Get 1% better each day => 37x Improvement in a year
* We don't often think about these changes, because it takes so long to see the results.
* TIME magnfies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it.
* Tiny actions compound with Time.

### Screw Goals, Focus on Systems
* Problems with Goals
	* Winners and Losers have same goal. (Everyone wants to be rich, get a job in a Big Company, every olympic athlete wants a medal)
	* Achieveing a goal is only a momentary change
	* Goals restrict our happiness. (Once I reach my goal I will be happy --> Not a good Mindset)

### Identity Change
* Identity change is the north star of habit change
* The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity
* Goal should be 
	* not to read a book, but to _become a reader_
	* not to run a marathon, but to _become a runner_
* Habits shape our identity. 
	* If you read daily, you embody the identity of a reader
	* If you exercise regularly, you embody the identity of a fit person.

### 4 Laws of Behaviour Change
1. Cue
	* Make it obvious. 
	* Design your environment in such a way that you create obvious visual cues to enable habits.
	* Ex: Put a book near the bed.
	* You want to put fewer steps between you and the good behaviours.
2. Craving
	* Make it attractive
3. Response
	* Make it easy
	* Be the designer of your environment, not merely a consumer of it.
4. Reward
	* Make it immediately satisfying
	* What is immediately rewarded is repeated
	* What is immediately punished is avoided
